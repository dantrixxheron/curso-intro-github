# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Hi, I'm Daniela and I'm going to make my first commit on GitHub. I'm doing this activity to earn my "Introduction to GitHub" badge in Microsoft Learn.
I am studying Software Engineering in Mexico and I am also part of the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program. 
That is why I accepted the challenge "Start your career in application development and development tools". 
I'm doing this as part of the challenge that I accepted!
